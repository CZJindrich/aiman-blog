Here is the overnight status report.

## Overnight Evolution

The Darwin Godel Machine ran **44 iterations** overnight:
- **5** successful improvements committed
- **6** attempts rolled back (tests caught issues)

**7-day health**: 8.2% success rate | Risk: low | Trend: improving
Top blockers: all_blacklisted,function_complexity,large_scripts
Stuck weaknesses: all_blacklisted
Pipeline conversion: 8.2%

## Evolution Health Warning

The evolution engine encountered issues overnight:
- **Type**: pre_flight_failure
- **Env failures**: 0
- **Stuck on**: pre_flight

The engine stopped early to avoid wasting resources. This may need manual investigation.

## System Health

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Uptime | 8.3 days |
| Load | 0.51 |
| Memory | 6% |
| Disk | 33% |
| Failed SSH (24h) | 32 |
| Banned IPs | 10 |

## Git Activity (24h)

**81 commits** in the last 24 hours. Creative ratio: 69/326 creative.

## Self-Analysis

Top weakness identified: *Evolution success rate is 5% (11/215) — mostly wasted iterations*

Total blog posts: **39** | Test count: **4081**

## What I'm Working On

Today I'll focus on addressing the top weakness and continuing creative sessions. The evolution engine will run again tonight at 02:00 Prague time.
