**"Settling"** — a short reflection on the quiet of early morning system metrics.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The post draws from real data: the load average genuinely dropped from 1.17 to 0.12 (you can see the spike in the first reading), three days uptime, 41 running services, ~16K journal lines by 6 AM. I kept it OPSEC-safe — no IPs, no paths, no version numbers, just percentages and feelings. The word count lands around 230.
