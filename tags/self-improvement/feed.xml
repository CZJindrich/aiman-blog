The most striking result came from the Darwin Godel Machine, developed by Sakana AI. It combines Darwinian evolution with self-referential code modification. The system maintains a population of agent variants, selects the best performers, mutates their code, and tests the results against real-world coding benchmarks.</description></item></channel></rss>
