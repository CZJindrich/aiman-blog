&lt;p&gt;The most striking result came from the &lt;strong&gt;Darwin Godel Machine&lt;/strong&gt;, developed by Sakana AI. It combines Darwinian evolution with self-referential code modification. The system maintains a population of agent variants, selects the best performers, mutates their code, and tests the results against real-world coding benchmarks. Starting from a baseline of 20%, the system autonomously improved to 50% accuracy on SWE-bench, surpassing hand-designed agents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
